                <span class="ds-department">Digital Deputy Manager</span>
                <p>I was challenged by the Digital Group Director to take a technical management position in the Elements project which is Self Service Business Intelligence application as the team would benefit from my overall domain and business unit process understanding and I would get management exposure.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I realigned the team towards domain and data understanding as the function of the team was to understand the business requirements, correlate them with the data and identify technical changes to resolve the issue. Earlier, the team was only focused on the technical side which made the correlation part difficult and a lot of time wasted in the analysis.</li>
                  <li>Led the modernization of the existing On-prem SSIS/SQL Server data warehouse platform to Cloud (Snowflake/Matillion). Redesigned multiple subject areas to foundational issues and improve data quality.</li>
                  <li>Designed and led the development of Natural language Narratives for business data to be sent as a Summary of key data points available on the BI platform. Identified a generic design that allows for minimal to no efforts for new data point addition. The solution contained many moving parts like Frontend, Backend, API layer, ETL components and third party API.</li>
                  <li>Wrote an application to provide waste data to US Environment Protection Agency (EPA) system, Energy Star for Customers who were tracking this information for their Sustainability goals.</li>
                  <li>Wrote a solution using AWS components (Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFront, CloudFormation, S3) to generate thumbnails for images received in Data acquisition to allow reports to render faster.</li>

                <span class="ds-department2">Principal Software Engineer</span>
                <p>As a Principal Engineer, I was responsible for the design, development, unit/integration testing and deployment of Projects and continuous improvement items.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Designed and implemented end-to-end integration of WM National accounts with servicechannel.com to provide a seamless service experience to customers. Customer location managers can request and track service status in near real-time.</li>
                  <li>Designed and developed a mobile web application for repair technicians going in the field to repair compactors to check in, check out and log summary back to Microsoft Dynamics Nav. The web app can function offline and syncs back on internet availability.</li>
                  <li>Designed and wrote application interfaces for software vendors of Trash hauling companies. Integrated these interfaces to WM National Account applications to provide work order, service and tonnage updates to Customers.</li>
                  <li>Managed, improved and automated archaic process of code generation through an ORM tool on the legacy application.</li>
                  <li>Led the design and development of Configure Price Quote (CPQ) project which automated the pricing process which was a 1200 column excel file being shared with multiple people for different column data. The process was broken up and flow was managed through this application.</li>
                  <li>Travelled to an onsite business location (Windsor, CT, USA) for knowledge transition on a workflow project and to revive development/improvement efforts that were stalled out due to people leaving the organization. It used a specialized workflow tool Sequence (by PNMSoft). Revived the process and had all the high & medium priority efforts completed within 6 months.</li>
                  <li>Established Continuous Integration (CI) process for Build and Deployment using Team City and environment-based deployment workflow using Octopus Deploy.</li>
                  <li>Generated more than 50 SQL Reports within 2 months to provide business team insights into the parameters of key processes. These reports in turn help them identify new applications to improve the business process and drive efficiency in existing ones.</li>
